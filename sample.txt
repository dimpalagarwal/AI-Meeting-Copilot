(Team Meeting - 22 Nov 2025)

**Priya:** Okay guys, let's start. So first, the login bug — it's still crashing when a user tries to reset password. Amit, you looked into it right?

**Amit:** Yeah, I checked. Seems like the token expiry logic is wrong. I’ll fix it. Should be done before Friday, I think.

**Riya:** Can we also update the dashboard UI? The "Tasks Overview" card looks dated. I’ll redesign it, but I need access to Figma library.

**Arjun:** I’ll give Riya access after the meeting.

**Priya:** Okay perfect. Also, the mobile optimization for homepage — this has been pending for a while. Who can take it?

**Sneha:** I can do it, but I’ll need backend support for API pagination.

**Amit:** Sure, I’ll help Sneha, but not this week. Maybe early next week.

**Priya:** So deadline for mobile optimization is… the end of next sprint. That’s December 5th.

**Deepak:** Also the deployment pipeline is failing on staging because of missing environment variables. Someone needs to fix that urgently.

**Arjun:** I’ll handle it. Should be done by tomorrow morning.

**Priya:** Great. Another thing — documentation for new onboarding flow is still incomplete.

**Sneha:** Oh yesss... sorry I forgot. I’ll finish it this weekend.

**Riya:** Can we also add dark mode toggle? Users asked twice last week.

**Priya:** Let’s put that as a low-priority backlog item for now.

**Deepak:** Also replace the test database — it's still using dummy 2023 data.

**Priya:** Yes, that must be updated. Who wants it?

**Amit:** I can, but only after login bug is done.

**Priya:** Alright noted.

**Riya:** And someone remind me to send assets to marketing…

**Priya:** Add it as a task. No one remembers later. 😂
